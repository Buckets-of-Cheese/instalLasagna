# INSTALLASAGNA

## User Story

This application helps any and all people who needs some guidance when they have an error while installing a program, or downloading new software on to their hardware. But most importantly it will help them cook up a tasty lasagna out of their spaghetti mess. The user can also be a contributor to the recipe enabling others to resolve their problems


## Description

This application can be used by other coders/developers as well as people who are not tech savvy to resolve their installation issues. They can either use the app as a guest or one can register themselves and thereby be able to write recipes and also contribute in making the existing recipes better. They will be able to edit their own recipes and be able to enhance recipes written by others. Once you are logged you will see all the recipes that have been created by you and be able to edit them if need be.
